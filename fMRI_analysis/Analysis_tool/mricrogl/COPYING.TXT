The image 'mni152_2009bet' is based on the ICBM 2009b Nonlinear Asymmetric 0.5mm T1 template image from Fonov et al. (2009) NeuroImage 47: S102

Chris Rorden used rescaled the provided 1mm brain mask to the 0.5mm image, and then applied a 2mm Gaussian smooth. This mask was used to modulate the T1 template (with the smoothing feathering the edges).

This image is based on the participants from the popular MNI152 template, but images were aligned using nonlinear transforms, whereas the MNI152 images used with FSL, SPM and AFNI are based on linear alignment.

Image pre-processing included non-uniform intensity correction (Sled, 1998) and intensity normalization to a range of 0-100. All T1w MRI data was then transformed into the Talairach-like MNI stereotaxic space using minctracc (Collins, Neelin et al. 1994). Brain masking was performed using BET (Smith, 2002). Age-based subgroups of subjects were created, and all scans within each group were then automatically re-registered to the stereotaxic space using the appropriate template. For each group, an iterative nonlinear co-registration algorithm (Grabner, Janke et al. 2006, Fonov, 2010 under review), was applied to obtain the group averages. The T1-based transformation was then applied to the T2, PD and tissue classified volumes to generate average atlases for these data. Methodological details can be found in (Fonov, 2010 under review).
